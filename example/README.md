# OAK Example

The example shows how to use ORM with
[Prana](https://github.com/phogolabs/prana).

If you want, you can setup the database via Prana CLI:

```bash
$ prana migration run
```

Otherwise when you run the example, it will setup the database by using `Migrate` function.

You can run the project by executing the `main.go`:

```bash
$ go run cmd/example-api/main.go
```
